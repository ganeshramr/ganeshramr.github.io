**Case Study: How to start a web server in go.**

When i was first introduced to NodeJs i was fasinated by how you can start a web server with just couple of lines of code. Go is no less awesome

I made the helloweb a bit more intresting - it will get the lat long from you browser , use google maps simple REST interface to get your geaorphy and print it.Code is documented.

</script>

so

1.Go functions are First-Class
2.Go variable can infer type if you say so using := . Note this is possibe only inside a func
3.Marking a statement as **defer** will run it before exiting func

And before i end this post, i used the cool *navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition* of HTML5 to read your geolocation

</script>

feel free to checkout and run the code.
