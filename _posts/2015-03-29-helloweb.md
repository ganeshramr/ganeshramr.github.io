**Case Study: How to start a web server in go.**

When i was first introduced to NodeJs I was fasinated by how you can start a web server with just couple of lines of code. Go is no less awesome.

I made the helloworld on web a bit more intresting - it will get your geolocation from your browser , use google maps simple REST interface to get your geaorphy and print it.Code is documented, read the comments bottoms up.

so

1. Go functions are First-Class
2. Go variable can infer type if you say so using := .Note this is possibe only inside a func.
3. Marking a statement as **defer** will run it before exiting func

And before i end this post, i used the cool ```navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition``` of HTML5 to read your 
geolocation
