I started with this simple hello.go

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("I am a gopher wannabe")
}

{% endhighlight %}


heavily influenced by my prior programming experinces ; having skipped reading some basics. I ran 

{%highlight go %}
go install hello
{%endhighlight %}

bang!!!!

{%highlight go %}
Error:go install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set)
{%endhighlight %}

Ok..

{%highlight go %}
go install hello.go
{%endhighlight %}

bang!!!!

{%highlight go %}
Error:go install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set)
{%endhighlight %}

I followed on to verify the things that go expects

	##How to organize the go folders ?
	1. Set GOPATH - this must be set to the home of all you go code 
	2. Define your work space - this must be $GOPATH/src . You need not set this as a system path ; but golang expects your code be organized in this fashion . Actually go needs the following defined 

	 - src [where all your source go]
	 - bin [this will be created and maintained by go. this is where go binaried live]
	 - pkg [home for all imported packages]
	 3.Add $GOPATH/bin to system PATH

I had all this set right, but still i got the error
