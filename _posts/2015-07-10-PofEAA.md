Enterprise Application Architecture : data intensive software systems on which so many businesses run
PofEAA: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
Source: http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/index.html
PofEAA:
- Domain Logic Pattern:
    - Transaction Script or Procedure pattern: Organize business logic as functions per use case like book hotel , cancel hotel
      for: simple business logic. functions/procedures coded by use case.

    - Domain Model: One object per table . Can get more RICH with complex relationship. Incorporates both behaviour and data
      for: complex and agile business logic

    - Table Module: A single instance that handles the business logic for all rows in a database table or view
      for: more like simple domain model.functions coded by domain. combine these to build use cases.
      #Room object will have all methods related to Room like availability and # of bedrooms etc

    - Service Layer: Typical service layer
      for: Presentation Layer --> Service layer -(domain objects)-> DAO -->DB

- Data Source Architectural Patterns:
    - Table Data Gateway Pattern: a class with CRUD for one table
      for: a bag for all *QL queries related to a particular table ex.findById(id). DAO for a table.

    - Row Data Gateway Pattern: A class with crud for one row in a table
      for: an Entity object

    - Active Record: A class for a row in db with business logic in it. RowDatGateway + domin logic
      for: an Entity with domain logic ; Person.getTaxableEarning()

    - Data Mapper: Map data to and from DB to in memory representation of DB.
      for: Entity Manager

- Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns:
    - Unit of Work: A Pattern that flushes out all database changes made during a business transaction collectively in one call

    - Identity map: Record of all data objects loaded and available already in a business transaction

    - Lazy Load:
      - Lazy Initialization: uses a special marker value (usually null) to indicate a field isn't loaded
      - Virtual Proxy: an object with the same interface as the real object
      - Value Holder: an object with a getValue method
      - ghost: is the real object without any data.The first time you call a method the ghost loads the full data into its fields

- Object-Relational Structural Patterns:
   - Identity Field: Database primary key. Id field in a entity

   - Foreign Key Mapping: Field used as a Refrence between entities

   - Association Table Mapping: Linker table object

   - Embedded Value: Mapping many fields into one object in Entity

   - Dependent table mapping: Album handling the mapping of tracks entity

   - Serialized LOB: Serialize large object in DB

   - Single table Inheritance: Player,Crickter,Bowler,Footballer through different entities all go into one class in DB

   - Class Table Inheritance: One entity per table

   - Concrete Table Inheritance: Table per CONCRETE entities.
   #these concrete entities will extend abstract classes and that abstract class will have no table

   - Inheritance Mapper: Abstract and concrete implementation od DB operations like save,insert.. in an inheritance model

- Web Presentation Patterns:
  - Model View Controller: MVC

  - Page Controller: handles a request for a specific page or action on a Web site

  - Front Controller:  Gate way of all requests for a WebSite

  - Templates View: Jsp tags in HTML

  - Transform View: A middle man converting model to HTML

  - Two Step View: Transform in 2 steps. Logical first and HTML later.

  - Application Controller: Centralized controller for screen navigation and flow

- Distribution Patterns:

  - Remote Facade: coarse-grained facade on fine-grained objects.
    #None of the fine-grained objects have a remote interface, and the Remote Facade contains no domain logic.
    # All the Remote Facade does is translate coarse-grained methods onto the underlying fine-grained objects.

  - DTO: POJO with serialization utilities.
```
