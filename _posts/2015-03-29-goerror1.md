**Case Study: Error:go install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set).**

I started with this simple hello.go

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/ganeshramr/go-projects/blob/master/hello/hello.go?footer=minimal">
</script>

Influenced by my prior programming experinces and having skipped reading some basics. I ran 

{% highlight go %}
go install hello
{% endhighlight %}
resulted in error

```
Error:go install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set)
```

Ok..

{%highlight go %}
go install hello.go
{%endhighlight %}

same error

{%highlight go %}
Error:go install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set)
{%endhighlight %}

I followed on to verify the things that go expects
###How to organize the go folders ?

1. Set GOPATH - this must be set to the home of all you go code 
2. Define your work space - this must be $GOPATH/src . You need not set this as a system path ; but golang expects your code be organized in this fashion . Actually go needs the following defined in the $GOPATH

- src [where all your source go]
- bin [this will be created and maintained by go. this is where go binaried live]
- pkg [home for all imported packages]

3.Add $GOPATH/bin to $PATH

This is how i have organized my folders 

```
$GOPATH
  --src
     --ganeshramr.github.com
        --go-projects
          --hello
            --hello.go
```

So i had all this set right, but i still got the error.I assumed something wrong with the code so i ran it

```go
go run hello.go
```
And I got the expected output

```
I am a gopher wannabe
```
so nothing is wrong with the code

Then i did what i should have done to begin with .I tried to understand what ```go install``` does reading.

```
go help install

Install compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies.
```

Couldn't make out much , but understood *install*  got to do something with the packages and not the individual go files

```go list all``` helped me list all the packages i had in my system and there at the bottom of the list saw my package listed ```ganeshramr.github.com/go-projects/hello```

Ok so ```go install ganeshramr.github.com/go-projects/hello``` Bingo!!! NO ERRORS

So what you really install is your package. The successful installation can be verfied by observing the package installed in **$GOPATH/bin** after which you can just run the program from command line using ```hello``` as you have  **$GOPATH/bin** in your system PATH.
